Welcome to the Shopware Tadpole organization!

This is a pond for open source projects connected to Shopware. Grown little tadpoles may become [FrOSh](https://github.com/friendsofshopware) one day if they survive and so may find the way to [Shopware Store](https://store.shopware.com/).

Please use this organization to collaborate with other developers, to drop your WIP extensions so others can pick it up and work along. If you want to collaborate, please feel free to contact any of the [members](https://github.com/orgs/shopware-tadpole/people) or drop us a message at [community@shopware.com](mailto:community@shopware.com).
