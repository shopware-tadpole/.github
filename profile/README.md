Welcome to the Shopware Tadpole organization!

This is a pond for open source projects connected to Shopware. Grown little tadpoles may become [FrOSh](https://github.com/friendsofshopware) one day if they survive and so may find the way to [Shopware Store](https://store.shopware.com/).

Please use this organisation to collaborate with other developers or to share your WIP, unfinished or product-ready extensions that you don't want to let rot in your drawer and therefore want to open-source so that others can pick them up and work along.

If you want to join or collaborate, please feel free to contact any of the [members](https://github.com/orgs/shopware-tadpole/people) or drop us a message at [community@shopware.com](mailto:community@shopware.com).
